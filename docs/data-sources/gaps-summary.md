# European Cover Crop Data — Gaps Summary

> **Date:** 2026-06-02  
> **Branch:** `feat/european-cover-crop-data`

## Executive Summary

Of the 12 species × 3 climates × 6 parameters = 216 possible data cells,
**132 are populated** (61%) from verified European sources.
**84 gaps** exist, of which **48 are "not applicable"** (grasses don't fix N,
some species-climate combos aren't agronomically viable), leaving
**36 genuine data gaps** requiring further research.

## Genuine Data Gaps (Action Required)

### Priority 1 — Critical for regenerative-sequence engine

| # | Gap | Impact | Proposed Action |
|---|-----|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **LTHSA × all climates × all parameters** | Cannot recommend grass pea in any rotation | Partner with IFAPA (Andalucía) or CIHEAM Zaragoza for Lathyrus trial data |
| 2 | **TRFIN × BSk × C/N ratio** | Missing decomposition rate for BSk crimson clover | Extrapolate from Csa data; mark as `data_gap: true` until INTIA trial confirmed |
| 3 | **TRFIN × BSk × frost_tolerance** | Risk of winterkill recommendation for BSk crimson clover | INTIA may have winter survival data in their legume trials. Check 2020–2024 reports. |

### Priority 2 — Important for completeness

| # | Gap | Impact | Proposed Action |
|---|-----|--------|-----------------|
| 4 | **N content for AVESA, SECCE in BSk/Cfb** | Can't calculate N immobilization risk precisely | Use C/N ratio to derive N content (N% ≈ 42 / C:N). Add derived flag. |
| 5 | **Protein crop C/N in BSk and Cfb** | Missing residue quality data for post-harvest management | Search DiverIMPACTS case studies for residue quality data |
| 6 | **MEDSA × BSk × single-cut biomass** | Alfalfa cover crop use case not studied in BSk | INTIA does alfalfa trials but for forage (3–5 cuts). Need dedicated cover crop termination trials. |

### Priority 3 — Nice to have

| # | Gap | Impact | Proposed Action |
|---|-----|--------|-----------------|
| 7 | **Frost tolerance for Cfb species** | Cfb frost events are rare → conservative estimates acceptable | Use Csa lower bound (warmer climate) as Cfb upper bound |
| 8 | **GDD for MEDSA (cover crop context)** | Alfalfa not typically terminated in first year | Mark as "forage context, not cover crop." Consider separate model for perennial ley rotations. |
| 9 | **LENCU × Cfb × all parameters** | Lentil not a significant crop in Cfb | Low priority. Accept Csa data as estimate for Cfb. |

## Not Applicable (by Design)

| Gap | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| AVESA N fixation | Grass species — does not fix atmospheric N |
| SECCE N fixation | Grass species — does not fix atmospheric N |
| GLXMA × BSk | Soybean requires irrigation in semi-arid — not agronomically viable without it |
| GLXMA frost tolerance | Soybean is frost-sensitive (0°C). Spring-sown only; frost tolerance is not a meaningful parameter. |

## Recommended Next Steps for Gap Closure

1. **INTIA deep scrape** (Weeks 1–2): INTIA website (intiasa.es) likely contains
   legume and cover crop reports not yet extracted. Same Drupal structure as
   nkz-navarra-agraria. Implement scraping pipeline following existing pattern.

2. **JRC MARS automated download** (Weeks 2–3): JRC Agri4Cast publishes regular
   PDF bulletins with structured phenology data. PDF table extraction pattern
   exists in nkz-genvce-scraper. Automate download + extraction for GDD parameters.

3. **Lathyrus targeted research** (Weeks 3–4): Contact CIHEAM Zaragoza, IFAPA,
   or Italian CREA for Lathyrus sativus trial data. This is a neglected crop
   with high potential for climate-resilient Mediterranean agriculture.

4. **ITACyL / IFAPA exploration** (Weeks 4–5): These Spanish regional institutes
   likely have legume trial data for continental (BSk) and Mediterranean (Csa)
   climates, respectively. Explore their technology transfer portals.
